### The run_analysis.R file in this repository performs the following functions in R:

1. Merges the training and the test data sets to create one large data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

3. Uses descriptive names for the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent, tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
